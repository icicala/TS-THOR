# THOR to Timesketch Mapper
This log conversion utility makes it easy to import THOR logs into Timesketch. Combining THOR findings on a shared timeline it enables cybersecurity analysts to enhance detection and analysis of malicious activity.
## Description
This utility processes THOR JSON logs and maps them to Timesketch’s required timeline format by:

* Extracting relevant fields from THOR logs

* Generating entries with the required Timesketch fields: message, datetime, and timestamp_desc

* Handling thor events with multiple timestamps by duplicating the log entry for each timestamp found
## Field Mapping Logic
This utility maps the following fields from THOR logs to Timesketch's required format:

* **message**: A key detection detail generated by THOR, providing context or justification for the event.

* **datetime**:
  * The THOR scan execution time, or
  * A timestamp found within the specific event related to a module or feature.

* **timestamp_desc**:
  * If datetime refers to the THOR scan start time → "Timestamp of THOR scan execution"
  * If datetime originates from a specific module field → "ModuleName - FieldName" (e.g., Filescan - modified)

**Note**: **ruledate** field is not mapped to datetime.

This utility supports THOR JSON log format v2 and is designed with forward compatibility for JSON log format v3.
## Features

1. Validates and reads the input THOR JSON file
2. Flattening THOR logs for efficient indexing and searching
3. Identifies the THOR log version and selects the appropriate mapper
4. Extracts relevant information and timestamps from each log entry
5. Maps THOR fields to Timesketch's required format (message, datetime, timestamp_desc)
6. Writes the mapped events to a single JSONL output file
7. The resulting .jsonl file can be ingested into Timesketch using either the Web UI or the [Importer CLI tool](https://timesketch.org/guides/user/cli-client/)

## Installation - MacOS/Linux
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher
* [THOR](https://www.nextron-systems.com/thor/) JSON logs (v2 or v3)
### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TBD/thor-ts-mapper.git
cd thor-ts-mapper
```
2. Make the installation script executable:
```bash
chmod u+x install_thor2ts.sh
```
3. Install thor2ts
```bash
. install_thor2ts.sh
```
This script will:

* Check for prerequisites.
* Clone or update the repository.
* Create and activate a virtual environment (venv-thor2ts).
* Install the package in editable mode.
* Test the installation by running thor2ts --version.

4. Future Use
To use thor2ts in the new terminal, activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source /path/to/thor-ts-mapper/venv-thor2ts/bin/activate
```
## Usage
Once the virtual environment is active, use the tool to convert THOR logs:

```bash
thor2ts <input_file> -o <output_file>
```

### Arguments
* `input_file` - Path to the THOR JSON file that you want to convert (required)
#### Example
```bash
thor2ts thor_scan.json
```
* `-o output_file` - Output file path (optional, default: <input_file_name>_mapped.jsonl)
#### Example
```bash
thor2ts thor_scan.json -o /path/to/output/thor2timesketch.jsonl
```
* `-v, --verbose` - Enable verbose output (optional)
#### Example
```bash
thor2ts thor_scan.json -v
```
* `--version` - Show the version of the tool and exit (optional)
#### Example
```bash
thor2ts --version
```

## Input Files
THOR scan log file (`.json`) log version **v2** or **v3**

## Output Files
The tool converts THOR JSON logs to Timesketch-compatible format. If no output file is specified, the output will be written to the same location as the input file with **"<input_file_name>_mapped.jsonl"** appended.
## Warning
The mapped file extension must end with .jsonl for successful ingestion into Timesketch. Files with other extensions (e.g json) may cause the import to fail.
## Ingesting into Timesketch
After conversion, the resulting (`.jsonl`) file can be ingested into Timesketch using either the Web UI or the `tsctl` [Importer CLI tool](https://timesketch.org/guides/user/cli-client/).
