# **THOR APT SCANNER** to Timesketch
This log conversion utility makes it easy to import [THOR](https://www.nextron-systems.com/thor/) logs into [Timesketch](https://timesketch.org/). Combining **THOR** findings on a shared timeline it enables cybersecurity analysts to enhance detection and analysis of malicious activity.

## Description
This utility processes **THOR** JSON logs and maps them to Timesketch’s required timeline format by:

* Extracting relevant fields from **THOR** logs

* Generating entries with the required Timesketch fields: message, datetime, and timestamp_desc

* Handling **THOR** events with multiple timestamps by duplicating the log entry for each timestamp found
---
## Field Mapping Logic
This utility maps the following fields from THOR logs to Timesketch's required format:

- **message**
  - A key detection detail generated by **THOR**, providing context or justification for the event.
- **datetime**
  - The **THOR** scan execution time, or
  - A timestamp found within the specific event related to a module or feature.
- **timestamp_desc**:
  - If datetime refers to the THOR scan start time → "Timestamp of THOR scan execution"
  - If datetime originates from a specific module field → "ModuleName - FieldName" (e.g., Filescan - modified)

**Note**: **ruledate** field is not mapped to datetime.

This utility supports THOR JSON log format v2 and is designed with forward compatibility for JSON log format v3.

## Features

1. Validate and read the input THOR JSON file
2. Identify the THOR log version and select the appropriate mapper
3. Extracts relevant information and timestamps from each log entry
4. Maps THOR fields to Timesketch's required format (message, datetime, timestamp_desc)
5. Write the mapped events to a single JSONL output file
6. The resulting .jsonl file can be ingested into Timesketch using either the Web UI or the [Importer CLI tool](https://timesketch.org/guides/user/cli-client/)
7. Supports ingestion into Timesketch sketch by specifying the sketch ID or name

## Installation for MacOS and Linux
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher
- Python venv package 
 *(e.g., on Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install python3-venv`)*
- [THOR](https://www.nextron-systems.com/thor/) JSON log version - v1.0.0 as input for `thor2ts`

### Steps
1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv thor2ts-venv
```
2. Activate the virtual environment `thor2ts-venv`:
```bash
source thor2ts-venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install thor2timesketch package:
```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple thor2timesketch
```

3. Future Use
To use `thor2ts` in the new terminal, activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source /path/to/thor2ts-venv/bin/activate
```

---

## Usage
Once the virtual environment is active, you can run the tool from the command line:

```bash
thor2ts <input_file> [-o <output_file>] [--sketch <sketch_id_or_name>] [-v]
```
### Command-Line Arguments
* `input-file` - Path to the THOR JSON file that you want to convert (required).

* `-o output-file` - Path to the output file (optional).

* `--sketch <sketch_id_or_name>` - Specifies the Timesketch sketch ID or name for automatic ingestion (optional).
  - If the sketch does not exist, it will be created.
* `-v, --verbose` - Enable verbose output (optional)
* `--version` - Show the version of the tool and exit (optional)
### Examples
- **File output**: Convert THOR JSON logs to Timesketch format and save to a file:
```bash
thor2ts thor_scan.json -o mapped_events.jsonl
```
- **Timesketch Ingestion**: Convert and ingest the THOR JSON events into a Timesketch sketch:
```bash
thor2ts thor_scan.json --ts_sketch "THOR APT Sketch"
```
- **Verbose Output**: Enable verbose output for debugging:
```bash
thor2ts thor_scan.json -o mapped_events.jsonl -v
```

## Configuration for Timesketch Ingestion
**First-time configuration**: When using this flag for the first time, you'll be prompted to configure Timesketch settings:
* `host_uri` - The URL of the Timesketch server.
* `auth_mode` - Authentication mode, valid choices are: "userpass" (user/pass) or "oauth"
* `username` - Your Timesketch username.
* `password` - Your Timesketch password. **Note:** The password will be tokenized.
This creates two configuration files in the user's home directory `$HOME/`:

  - `~/.timesketch.token` - Stores authentication tokens
  - `~/.timesketchrc` - Stores connection configuration with the following format:
```ini
[timesketch]
host_uri = http://timessketch.example.com
username = yourusername
verify = True
client_id = 
client_secret = 
auth_mode = userpass
cred_key = <generated_key>
```
For more detailed information about the Timesketch API client configuration and usage, please check out the [Timesketch API client documentation](https://timesketch.org/developers/api-client/).

## Input and Output Files

**Input Files:**
- **THOR** JSON log files (version **v1.0.0**).

**Output Files:**
- The tool produces a JSONL file containing timesketch formated events.
- If the specified output file does not end with `.jsonl`, the tool updates the extension.
- If the file exists, new events are appended.
- If the output directory does not exist, it is created automatically.
### Warning
> Timesketch accepts only **JSON** files with a `.jsonl` extension. [Timesketch documentation](https://timesketch.org/guides/user/import-from-json-csv/)

---
## Ingesting into Timesketch
### File `jsonl`
The resulting (`.jsonl`) file can be ingested into Timesketch using either the Web UI or the [Importer CLI tool](https://timesketch.org/guides/user/cli-client/).
### Sketch flag
If you specify the `--sketch` flag, the tool will automatically ingest the mapped events into the specified Timesketch sketch.
After uploading, the tool monitors the **indexing process** for `60 seconds`. If indexing completes within this window, you'll see a success message, otherwise, the indexing continues in the background within Timesketch while the tool exits.
